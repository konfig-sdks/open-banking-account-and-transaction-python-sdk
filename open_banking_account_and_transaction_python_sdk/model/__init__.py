# we can not import model classes here because that would create a circular
# reference which would not work in python2
# do not import all models into this module because that uses a lot of memory and stack frames
# if you need the ability to import all models from one package, import them with
# from open_banking_account_and_transaction_python_sdk.models import ModelA, ModelB
